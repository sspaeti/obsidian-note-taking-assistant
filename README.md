# Obsidian Note-Taking Assistant

The goal is to ask question to my local second brain (7000+ markdown files) like:
- Show me my notes on "X"
- Notes that are relevant from my vault.
- Which note is most relevant to "Note X or Term"
- Highlight any disagreements between the notes


## Workflow

1. Convert Markdown notes, formatted like below into Vectors (Embeddings)

```md
